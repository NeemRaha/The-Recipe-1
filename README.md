# The-Recipe-1
In this project, I created a web application called "The Recipe using Forkify API." This app serves as the kitchen's major information hub, connecting users to recipe ideas, ingredient lists, and cooking instructions. It will be most useful for those who use digital tools to plan their food, which is nearly everyone these days.

The following are the many functions made available to users on this website. Users can look for their favorite foods. The search results include information such as the ingredients list, total cooking time, and preparation instructions. Users can construct their favorite recipe collection by liking the recipes featured and adding their recipes. The liked recipes are saved in the user's account, and the user can see, add, and delete them at any time from his recipe collection.

The application will communicate with the Forkify API to consume data from it. The Forkify API is a large recipe information aggregator with thousands of recipes.
